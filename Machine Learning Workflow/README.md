This jupyter notebook is the first of a serie dedicated to the machine learning workflow using a dataset retrieved from a Kaggle competition entitled *House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques* and available in the *data* folder.

The aim is to build a model to predict the price of a home based on 81 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

The *Data Pre Processing for Machine Learning with Python.ipynb* covers the steps of EDA, data cleaning and data pre-processing.
